<br><b>Here are 4 Ways To Segregate Waste in Apartments<br></b>
<br>1) Wet/Kitchen Waste<br>
This comprises items like fruit peels, leftovers, vegetable skins, uncooked food, coffee or tea powder, and garden waste like leaves and twigs. <br>
 
Maintain a drum, container or a bin to deposit such waste, so that it can be converted into rich organic compost. You can choose your composting process.<br> Examples include vermicomposting, aerobic and anaerobic composting. 
<br>2) Dry waste
Dry waste is divided into recyclable and non-recyclable waste.  Items like used paper towels, hazardous chemical or food containers, foam materials, and dishware are some examples of dry waste that cannot be recycled or reused. 
 
Dry recyclable waste includes pet bottles, plastic carry bags, newspapers, glass bottles, shoes, plastic cutlery, tires, cardboard, and so on.<br>
If the recyclable waste is segregated further, it can fetch you money or goodies. From online kabadiwalas, local scrap dealers, recycling centres, <br>raddiwalas to municipal corporations, there are several sources you can submit your dry waste to and get something in return.  
Since dry waste only consists of 30-40% of the total household waste, maintain a recyclable bin and give it away every once or twice a week.
<br>3) Sanitary Waste 
Diapers (adults and babies), synthetic sanitary napkins, hygiene-related products, condoms, tampons, soiled napkins are classified as sanitary waste. <br>Medical waste consists of linens, bedding, items contaminated with blood or body fluids, soiled plaster casts and other types of dressing. 
Medical and sanitary waste has to be incinerated, microwaved or autoclaved to avoid the spread of diseases. <br>
 
Since not every city or village in India is equipped with facilities to treat the waste scientifically, the best way to dispose of them is to wrap it<br> in a<br> newspaper and mark it with a red dot for easy identification.   
<br>4) E-waste 
There are three types of electronic waste you must be aware of:<br>
Bulky: Fridge, microwave or anything is that is difficult to carry around.<br>
Hazardous: Tubelights, light bulbs, toner cartridges, batteries, monitors and screens. Anything with a chemical component.<br>
Non-hazardous: Cables, chargers, microwaves, gadgets like laptops and phones.<br>
Collect all the e-waste in a container, and you can follow a weekly, monthly or yearly disposal process. <br>
Just like dry waste, there are several public e-waste drop off points, online collection services, recycling centres where you can donate or trade your<br> electronic waste.

How to Segregate Waste At Work<br>
Most of the offices follow a two-bin systemâ€”one for recyclable waste and one for wet garbage. But just like your home, the more you segregate, the better<br> the waste management.
